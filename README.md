gw2craft
========

These are all the python files that generate http://gw2crafts.net

Requires Python 2.7.x and Linux (Mint 14).

Crafting.py is the main file.  Due to differences in how multiprocessing is implemented on Windows and Linux, this script is written specifically for Linux and also takes advantage of some coding elements that only work on Linux.
