gw2craft
========

These are all the Python files that generate http://gw2crafts.net

Requires Python 2.7.x.  You will need to define a ftp_info.py file which contains 3 strings; ftp_url, ftp_user, and ftp_pass.


**Primary .py Files:**

Crafting -- The main file.

MakeGuide -- Calculated the actual guides based on prices and recipes.

MyPrices -- Gathers pricing data for generating the guides.  Primary resource is GW2 API.  Replace "u'cost':sitem[u'sells'][u'unit_price']" with "u'cost':sitem[u'buys'][u'unit_price'] if sitem[u'buys'][u'unit_price'] > Items.ilist[item][u'vendor_value'] else sitem[u'sells'][u'unit_price']" on line 197 to create guides based on buy orders of materials instead of lowest sale price.

MyPrint -- Functions for generating human readable output.

Globals -- Initializes a couple global variables and provides a global function.

Gen_ifn -- generates the localized FAQ, nav and index pages.

Localxx -- Localized language files.  Need to be updated by hand.

Create_recipes -- creates all the secondary .py files you will need.  A recent snapshot of those files is included.

**Secondary .py Files:**

Armorsmith, Artificer, Chef, Chef_karma, Huntsman, Jeweler, Leatherworker, Tailor -- Contain all recipes used by Crafting.py indexed by itemid(int).

Items_xx -- Contains itemid:name pairs for outputting item names in the correct language.

Items -- contains item_id indexed dictionary of thumbnail url, item count, rarity, vendor value, type, and if the item is discovered.

How-To
======

**Update recipes:**

Run Create_recipes.py and when it finished you will have updated recipes for Crafting.py

**Setup guide output:**

If you want to upload the guides to AWS, create a ftp_info.py file with the variables amakey and amasec.  Both variables should be strings.

If you want to output the guides locally, rather than uploading, open Output.py and comment out this line:
```python
from output_aws import write_file		# For uploading files to AWS
```

and uncomment this line:
```python
#from output_local import write_file	# For writing files to disk
```

If you want to upload the guides via FTP, comment out the same AWS line in output.py, and uncomment this line:
```python
#from output_ftp import write_file		# For uploading files via FTP
```
Additionally, create a ftp_info.py file with the variables ftp_url, ftp_user, and ftp_pass.  All 3 variables should be strings.

**Generate guides:**

Run Crafting.py, this step is much faster if you use pypy, and it will generate your guides.
